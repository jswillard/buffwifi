This project allows users to find the best areas on CU campus in terms of wifi speed and to compare their results with the results of their peers also using the application. The app takes speed test data self-reported by the users (with their permission) and uses that data to generate estimates of the wifi speeds across campus. This data is then used to create charts that display the wifi speeds at the user's current location for the past day, giving the user a better estimate of how their speeds compare to others in the same building. It also allows for side-by-side comparison of these charts with other locations on campus, allowing users to easily access a detailed comparison of their current location with any other building on campus. This is expanded uopn with the map view, which provides less speed information per building but allows the user to see the entire campus at the same time. This map is then color coded based on the estimated wifi speed of the building so that the user can see the best and worst buildings on campus in real time.

The application can be accessed via the link below:

This repo contains the code used to build and develop the Heroku app implementation of the project.
