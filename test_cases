Test 1: Submission of Results
User should only be able to access the results page after these conditions are met:
  -User has accepted locations permissions for the website
  -User has filled all results fields before attempting to submit results
  -Submitted results are non-negative integers less than 1000
  
  Test Case 1:
  -User will decline locations permissions
  -User will attempt to submit results with entries: 20|90|15
  Expected Result: User should not be able to access results page since they declined locations permissions
  
  Test Case 2:
  -User will accept locations permissions
  -User will attempt to submit results with entries: -|90|15
  Expected Result: User should not be able to access the results page since one of the form entries is blank
  
  Test Case 3:
  -User will accept locations permissions
  -User will attempt to submit results with entries: 20|-90|15
  Expected Result: User should not be able to access results page since not all results are non-negative integers
  
  Test Case 4:
  -User will accept locations permissions
  -User will attempt to submit results with entries: 20|90|15
  Expected Result: User should be able to access results page
  
 Test 2: Comparing Location Speed
 User should be able to compare current location's speeds to those of another selected location
 In order to do this, the user should follow these steps:
  -Locate the chart section of the page after running the speed test
  -If not already under "Chart View" tab, select that tab
  -Select drop-down menu under "compare another location"
  -Select a location other than the current location
  
  Test Case 1:
  -User will follow the steps above from the Engineering Center, selecting UMC to compare with
  Expected Result:
  -Two wifi speed charts should be shown, Engineering Center on the left and UMC on the right
  -Charts should be populated with data points
  -The most recent data point for the Engineering Center should match the data in the table above
    which details the user's speed test data
  -The most recent data point for the UMC should match the wifi speed obtained by hovering over
    the UMC on the map
    
  Test Case 2:
  -User will follow the steps above from the Engineering Center, selecting the Enginnering Center to 
    compare with
  Expected Result:
  -Two wifi speed charts should be shown, both representing the Engineering Center
  -Charts should be populated with data points
  -The most recent data point for the Engineering Center should match the data in the table above
    which details the user's speed test data
  -The most recent data point for the Engineering Center should match the wifi speed obtained by hovering over
    the Engineering Center on the map
    
  Test Case 3:
  -User will follow the steps above from the Engineering Center, not selecting a location to compare with
  Expected Result:
  -Two wifi speed charts should be shown, Engineering Center on the left and the right one blank
  -Only the left chart should be populated with data points
  -The most recent data point for the Engineering Center should match the data in the table above
    which details the user's speed test data
  -The most recent data point for the Engineering Center should match the wifi speed obtained by hovering over
    the Engineering Center on the map
    
Test 3: Wifi status of all locations across campus
User should be able to compare speeds at all locations across campus using the map
In order to do this, the user should follow these steps:
 -Locate the map section of the page after running the speed test
 -If not already under "Map View" tab, select that tab
  
  Test Case 1:
  -User will follow the steps above from the Engineering Center
  Expected Result:
  -Each building has a color that is based on its most recent wifi speed test
  -The color can be cross-referenced with a legend that associates a color with a range of wifi speeds
  -When the user hovers over a building, estimated wifi statistics are displayed to the user
  -The speeds provided from hovering over the Engineering Center incorporate the user's speed test
    and are related to the speed test data displayed at the top of the page
  -The speeds provided from hovering over the Engineering Center are related to the last entry in the chart
    for the Engineering Center
  -No other location's speeds are impacted by the results of the previous test
  
  Test Case 1:
  -User will follow the steps above from the UMC
  Expected Result:
  -Each building has a color that is based on its most recent wifi speed test
  -The color can be cross-referenced with a legend that associates a color with a range of wifi speeds
  -When the user hovers over a building, estimated wifi statistics are displayed to the user
  -The speeds provided from hovering over the UMC incorporate the user's speed test
    and are related to the speed test data displayed at the top of the page
  -The speeds provided from hovering over the UMC are related to the last entry in the chart
    for the UMC
  -No other location's speeds are impacted by the results of the previous test
